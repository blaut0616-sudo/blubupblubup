  <h2>For you, my binaa 💌</h2>
  <p>
Sometimes I fall quiet, not because I’ve stopped caring, but because love has become something I hold silently, something that stays even when words don’t. If a thousand hearts loved you, I’d be among them. If only one remained, it would still be mine. And if someday none did, that must mean I’m no longer here. I don't love you less because I write you less, perhaps I love you more because I think of you quietly.

Lately, it feels like something between us has grown distant, like warmth fading into a chill we never asked for. We used to fill every silence with laughter, tease each other endlessly, talk until the night forgot the clock. Now, it’s like the quiet has a sound of its own. I’m not blaming you, or myself. I just miss us. I miss the way we used to fit so effortlessly. The way love used to feel like home for two of us. But still, I want to keep rediscovering you, over and over, as if love has endless beginnings.

You’re not just someone I see, you’re someone I feel. You stay, you linger, and you leave warmth that refuses to fade, at least for me.

And even though things between us have grown colder, even when arguments seem to come more often than laughter, when I beg for a little attention while you’re not in your best mood, please know I never mean to make things harder for you, for us. I just care too much. Maybe the way we both love isn’t the same, but I hope one day, we’ll learn how to meet in the middle. I hope we can still understand each other, even when love feels quietly hard lately.

I don’t think loving you could ever feel ordinary. You’re a story I’ll never finish reading, one I’ll always want to open again, no matter how many times I’ve seen the same page.

I love u so deeply, sayang.
